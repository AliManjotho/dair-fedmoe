\begin{abstract}
Encrypted traffic classification (ETC) is essential for network management and security enforcement. Recently, federated learning (FL) has offered decentralized, privacy-preserving training across distributed clients for enabling robust ETC. However, in real-world federated learning scenarios with increasing client heterogeneity, feature drift, concept drift, and label drift co-occur distributed across both temporal and client dimensions. While existing studies have addressed individual drift types or combinations thereof, the joint detection and adaptation to the triad within a single FL framework remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Drift‐Adaptive, Imbalance‐aware, RL‐Managed Federated Mixture‐of‐Experts (DAIR‐FedMoE) framework. DAIR‐FedMoE augments a GShard Transformer backbone with a hierarchical mixture-of-experts (HMoE) layer. This layer scores each encrypted-flow against its client's historical distributions for drift detection and routes it to either stable experts (for consistent patterns) or drift-specialist experts (for evolving traffic), thereby adapting to distributed feature and concept drift. Then, within each expert, we employ adaptive loss reweighting via expert confidence, dynamically up-weighting classes on which the expert exhibits low certainty to mitigate distributed label drift (dynamic class imbalance across clients). Finally, a reinforcement learning–based policy network on the server continuously manages the expert pool, pruning underutilized experts, spawning new drift specialists, or merging redundant ones, thus effectively managing the concepts. We evaluate DAIR‐FedMoE on federated splits of ISCX-VPN and ISCX-Tor for classification accuracy, and on CIC-IDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 with simulated drift and class imbalance. The results demonstrate substantial gains in macro-F1, minority-class recall, and drift-recovery speed over state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving privacy and communication efficiency.

%However, existing FL-based methods have largely underexplored two co-occurring challenges in real-world traffic streams: distributed concept drift and class imbalance, which critically undermine model reliability. To address these issues, we introduce Drift‐Adaptive, Imbalance‐aware, RL‐Managed Federated Mixture‐of‐Experts (DAIR‐FedMoE) framework. DAIR‐FedMoE builds on a GShard Transformer backbone by replacing each MoE layer with a novel hierarchical MoE layer. This layer scores each encrypted-flow for drift and routes it to either stable experts (for consistent patterns) or drift-specialist experts (for evolving traffic), thereby adapting to distributed concept drift. Then, within each expert, we employ adaptive loss reweighting via expert confidence, dynamically up-weighting classes on which the expert exhibits low certainty to mitigate class imbalance. Finally, a reinforcement learning-based policy network on the server continuously manages the expert pool, pruning underutilized experts, spawning new drift specialists, or merging redundant ones, ensuring the model's capacity adapts to evolving data. We evaluate DAIR‐FedMoE on federated splits of ISCX-VPN and ISCX-Tor for classification accuracy, and on CIC-IDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 with simulated drift and class imbalance. The results demonstrate substantial gains in macro-F1, minority-class recall, and drift-recovery speed over state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving privacy and communication efficiency.
	
%The growing adoption of encryption protocols in internet traffic has significantly complicated the task of traffic classification, essential for network management and security enforcement. Traditional centralized models face scalability and privacy limitations, while federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling decentralized model training across distributed clients.

Finally, a reinforcement-learning policy network on the server continuously manages the expert pool, pruning underutilized experts, spawning new drift specialists, or merging redundant ones, based on utilization, performance, and drift statistics, ensuring the model's capacity adapts to evolving data. We evaluate DAIR-FedMoE on encrypted traffic benchmarks, including ISCX-VPN, ISCX-Tor and VNAT for general classification performance, and federated splits of CIC-IDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 with simulated drift and imbalance to assess concept drift adaptation and class imbalance mitigation. The results demonstrate superior performance against state-of-the-art baselines, all while preserving data privacy and communication efficiency.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{E}{ffective} identification of traffic types and security threats is critical for network management, intrusion detection, and quality of service enforcement in modern IoT and edge deployments. The rapid expansion of encrypted internet traffic, driven by privacy‐preserving protocols and use of virtual private networks, has created a significant obstacle for traditional traffic classification systems. At the same time, large scale and diverse data collected at edge devices has motivated ETC to shift from centralized solutions to FL paradigm, enabling collaborative model training on encrypted‐flow features without sharing user data. However, these FL systems bring their own challenges such as heterogeneity and drift in data distributions across clients.

Early traffic classifiers relied on handcrafted feature extraction and centralized training of deep neural networks. In recent years, ETC has increasingly adopted FL to leverage data diversity across edge devices while preserving user privacy. Approaches based on federated averaging of convolutional and recurrent architectures have been employed to learn discriminative representations across distributed clients. Concurrently, mixture-of-experts (MoE) frameworks have been introduced in FL to enhance model capacity and personalization by dynamically routing client data to specialized expert subnetworks. To address non-IID data and distributional shifts, several FL studies have focused on adapting to changes in the joint distribution $P(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$, where $\mathcal{X}$ denotes the feature space and $\mathcal{Y}$ is the label space. These solutions are typically categorized into single-global model or multi-global model strategies, depending on how they manage distributional heterogeneity. In contrast, a more fine-grained line of work decomposes the joint distribution as $P(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})=P(\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{X})P(\mathcal{X})$ or $P(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})=P(\mathcal{X}|\mathcal{Y})P(\mathcal{Y})$, and adapts to specific types of drift or their combinations. These include concept drift (changes in conditional distribution $P(\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{X})$), feature drift (shifts in feature marginal  $P(\mathcal{X})$), and label drift (variations in label marginal $P(\mathcal{Y})$, also referred to as dynamic class-imbalance).
%Early traffic classifiers relied on handcrafted feature extraction and centralized training of deep neural networks. More recent works in ETC have explored FL, harnessing the data diversity in edge devices and adopting techniques such as federated averaging of convolutional or recurrent architectures to learn discriminative patterns across clients. In parallel, mixture‐of‐experts (MoE) approaches have been proposed in FL to improve model capacity and personalization by routing client data to specialized subnetworks. Several works within FL have studied data heterogeneity and drift by adapting to any changes in the joint distribution $P(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$, with $\mathcal{X}$ being the features and $\mathcal{Y}$ being the labels. These approaches are further classified as single or multiple global models to handle the concepts. While other line of work decomposes the joint distribution as $P(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})=P(\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{X})P(\mathcal{Y})$ or $P(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})=P(\mathcal{X}|\mathcal{Y})P(\mathcal{X})$ and adapts to any changes in either or combination thereof within conditional distribution $P(\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{X})$ (real concept drift), feature marginal $P(\mathcal{X})$ (feature drift), and label marginal $P(\mathcal{Y})$ (label drift). 

Despite recent advances, federated encrypted traffic classification continues to face two fundamental challenges. First, real-world ETC deployments encounter simultaneous, distributed, and overlapping changes across $P(\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{X})$, $P(\mathcal{X})$, and $P(\mathcal{Y})$. Treating all such variations as joint drift in $P(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$ leads to drift entanglement, making it difficult to apply targeted mitigation strategies. Moreover, failing to adapt feature, concept, and label drifts simultaneously, undermines the robustness, fairness, and accuracy of the global model over time. For instance, ignoring distributed feature drift may lead to poor generalization in local models, misleading drift attribution, and noisy global aggregation. Overlooking distributed concept drift can confuse noise with real semantic shifts, result in an inaccurate global model due to outdated mapping logic in clients, and cause adaptation fatigue from frequent and necessary client updates. Similarly, ignoring distributed label drift biases gradients toward majority classes and fosters overconfidence in obsolete label priors. A truly resilient FL system must therefore detect and adapt to all three drifts simultaneously. Second, while multi-global models offer better personalization and adaptation to client heterogeneity and distribution shifts, they introduce storage, communication, and computational overhead. Additionally, they require a meta-classifier or clustering system to assign clients to models, which may itself drift. Finally, as the number of global models grows, each model is trained on fewer clients, reducing generalization. 



%
%
%Several works with in FL have studied the three frequent challenges arising due to data heterogeneity: first, the feature drift expressed as change in marginal distribution on feature space $P(X)$; second, concept drift arises when clients' local traffic distributions evolve asynchronously, due to new application protocols, seasonal usage patterns, or adversarial evasion, caused by change in conditional distribution of feature to label mapping $P(Y|X)$; third, label drift (dynamic class imbalance), where rare traffic or attack types are vastly outnumbered by common or benign traffic, resulting in poor minority‐class detection and change in marginal over label space $P(Y)$. Several approaches exploit single-global model solution \cite{single-model-1, single-model-2} but they struggle to adapt to these drifts if they vary across clients (distributed drift). On the other hand, multi-global model solutions \cite{feddrift, fedccfa} handle distributed drift by introducing multiple global models to handle different concepts.
%
%Despite this progress, federated encrypted‐traffic classification still faces two key challenges. First, most methods fail to address feature drift, concept drift, and label drift simultaneously, undermining the robustness, fairness, and accuracy of the global model over time. Ignoring distributed feature drift may lead to poor generalization in local models, misleading drift attribution (falsely interpreting feature drift as concept drift), noisy global aggregation, and misaligned feature extractors with evolving client distributions. Ignoring distributed concept drift fixes \(P(Y|X)\) too rigidly, confuses noise with real semantic shift, leads to inaccurate global model due to outdated mapping logic in clients, and incurs adaptation fatigue due to frequent and meaningful client updates. Overlooking distributed label drift biases gradients toward majority classes, skews the global model, undermines fairness, and fosters overconfidence in obsolete label priors. A truly resilient FL system must therefore detect and adapt to all three drifts simultaneously. Second, deploying multiple global models can improve personalization and adaptation to client heterogeneity, but it incurs steep storage, communication, and computational overhead. It also relies on meta‐classification or clustering to assign clients to models, mechanisms that themselves may drift, and with more global models, each model is trained on fewer clients, reducing generalization. An effective FL framework must strike a balance between comprehensive drift adaptation and practical efficiency. Second, while multiple-global models offer better personalization and adaptation to client heterogeneity and distribution shifts, they introduces new challenges. This includes storage, communication, and computational overhead. Additionally, it requires a meta-classifier or clustering system to assign clients to models, which may itself drift. Finally, as number of global models grows, each model is trained on fewer clients, reducing generalization.



To address the multifaceted challenges of distributed drift and system efficiency in federated encrypted traffic classification, we propose DAIR-FedMoE, a Drift-Adaptive, Imbalance-Aware, RL-Managed Federated Mixture-of-Experts framework. DAIR-FedMoE simultaneously adapts to distributed concept, feature, and label drifts across both temporal and client dimensions, while maintaining storage, computation, and communication efficiency via a single global MoE model, all without compromising user privacy. 

The DAIR-FedMoE framework integrates three key components: (1) Drift-adaptive expert routing via hierarchical MoE: At its core, DAIR-FedMoE incorporates a two-tier HMoE sublayer within a GShard Transformer that builds drift-adaptive expert trees. Each incoming traffic flow is scored for drift and drift type, quantifying how dissimilar it is from the client's historical traffic and incurring type of drift (feature or concept), thereby routed accordingly. Stable samples are directed to long-standing experts trained on consistent patterns (stable regime), while drifting samples are routed to freshly allocated drift-specialist experts (drift regime), allowing the system to adapt novel patterns such as emerging protocols or evasion techniques without disrupting stable knowledge; (2) Confidence-guided loss reweighting for imbalance adaptation: Each expert independently monitors its class-wise prediction confidence via entropy tracking over time. Classes that consistently exhibit high uncertainty, often minority or newly drifting labels, are assigned higher loss weights during training. This self-adaptive reweighting mechanism enables the model to allocate more capacity to underrepresented or uncertain classes, effectively mitigating label drift (dynamic class imbalance) without requiring manual hyperparameter tuning; and (3) RL-managed expert lifecycle optimization: To dynamically manage model complexity, a server-side reinforcement learning agent, based on Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO), oversees the lifecycle of experts. By monitoring metrics such as expert utilization, drift intensity, and performance gain, the policy learns when to prune stale experts, spawn new ones for emerging drifts, or merge redundant specialists. This adaptive resizing ensures the expert pool remains efficient, focused, and responsive to real-world changes, avoiding both underfitting and capacity waste. Together, these components enable DAIR-FedMoE to jointly detect and adapt to feature, concept, and label drifts while maintaining system efficiency and user privacy.

This main contributions of the paper are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We propose a unified framework DAIR-FedMoE, for detecting and adapting to distributed feature, concept, and label drift simultaneously. A two‐tier hierarchical MoE sublayer in a GShard Transformer, routes encrypted‐flow tokens between stable and drift experts to handle feature and concept drift. In parallel, an entropy‐driven adaptive loss reweighting within each expert mitigates label drift by focusing uncertain classes.
	
	\item We design an RL-managed expert policy for drift adaptation and expert lifecycle optimization. A server-side actor–critic network, continuously monitors expert utilization, drift intensity, and performance trends to learn when to prune, spawn, or merge experts. This dynamic expert management enables the system to efficiently adapt to evolving distributions and emerging concepts, ensuring model capacity.
		
	\item We demonstrate effectiveness our unified framework DAIR‐FedMoE on federated splits of ISCX‐VPN, ISCX‐Tor, CIC‐IDS2017, and UNSW‐NB15, achieving significant improvements in macro‐F1, minority‐class recall, and drift‐recovery speed, while preserving privacy and communication efficiency.
\end{itemize}


%To address the intertwined challenges of distributed drift, class imbalance, and efficiency in federated encrypted traffic classification, we introduce DAIR-FedMoE: a Drift-Adaptive, Imbalance-Aware, RL-Managed Federated Mixture-of-Experts framework. DAIR-FedMoE is a unified solution to handle concept, feature, and label drifts simultaneously across both temporal and client dimensions in federated learning, while preserving privacy and resource efficiency through a single global MoE model. It integrates three core components: (1) a two-tier hierarchical MoE sublayer within a GShard Transformer that dynamically separates and routes stable and drifting traffic flows to specialized experts based on a drift scoring mechanism, enabling targeted adaptation without catastrophic forgetting. This detects and adopts to distributed feature and concept drift; (2) a confidence-guided loss reweighting strategy, where each expert tracks its class-wise certainty and adaptively up-weights loss for under-confident or under-represented classes, thereby mitigating label drift (dynamic class imbalance) in a decentralized and data-driven manner; and (3) a reinforcement learning-based expert pool management module, where a server-side actor–critic policy continuously adjusts the number of experts by monitoring drift intensity, utilization, and performance—spawning, pruning, or merging experts as needed. Through this integrated design, DAIR-FedMoE achieves scalable, personalized, and drift-resilient learning in real-world, non-stationary federated environments.

%
%
%It integrates three key components: First, a two-tier hierarchical MoE sublayer within the GShard Transformer implements drift-adaptive expert trees, scoring each sample for drift and routing it to either stable experts or drift specialists. By scoring each traffic flow for ``how different'' it looks from a client's historical traffic, DAIR-FedMoE separates ``stable'' patterns from ``drifting'' ones right at the HMoE layer. Stable samples ride through experts that have seen similar data for many rounds (stable-regime), while drifted samples are routed to a fresh set of specialist experts tuned to recent changes (drift-regime). This hard split means that when, a new application protocol or an evasion technique appears, only the drift experts adapt to it, preserving the integrity of the older, well-learned knowledge in the stable experts; Second, a confidence-guided loss reweighting meachanism is introduced, where each expert tracks its certainty per class and dynamically up-weights the loss for classes on which it is least confident. Within each expert, we dynamically gauge ``how sure'' the model is about each class by tracking its softmax entropy over time. Classes where the expert is consistently uncertain (often the rare or newly drifting ones) get their loss up-weighted during training. In effect, each expert focuses extra capacity on the labels it struggles with, automatically correcting for the long-tail imbalance without manual tuning of class weights; Finally, an RL-managed expert lifecycle on the server manages expert regimes. Even with drift detection and loss reweighting, the right number of experts isn't fixed, it depends on how many distinct patterns and rare classes are active. A server-side PPO policy watches trends in expert usage, drift intensity, and performance gains, and learns when to prune stale experts, spawn new ones for emerging drifts, or merge redundant specialists. This continual resizing of the expert pool ensures the model never wastes capacity on obsolete patterns and always has enough ``heads'' to cover new or under-represented concepts. To the best of our knowledge, DAIR-FedMoE is first unified framework that handles all the three drifts simultaneously across time and space (clients).

\subsection{Encrypted Traffic Classification}
Traditional network traffic classification techniques, such as port-based and payload-based methods, have become less effective due to the widespread adoption of encryption protocols like TLS and VPNs. To address this, researchers have turned to machine learning approaches that rely on statistical features and flow-level metadata. Recent studies have explored deep learning architectures. For instance, DeepPacket \cite{deeppacket} performs end-to-end packet classification, while Meng et al. \cite{graphdapp} use GNNs to model packet dependencies. Kunda et al. \cite{tscrnn} apply time-series CNN-RNNs for temporal patterns, and Shizhou et al. \cite{cmtsnn} introduced CMTSNN for multi-task classification. FS-Net \cite{liuFsNet33} improves accuracy via flow-based feature selection, and Tal et al. \cite{flowpic} convert flow features into images for analysis. FlowGNN \cite{flowGnn} captures relational flow information, and Liu et al. \cite{atvitsc} combine vision transformers with spatiotemporal feature extraction. Recent models like PERT \cite{pert} and ET-BERT \cite{linBert51} use pre-training and fine-tuning on large, unlabeled data. Despite progress, challenges such as data dependency, overfitting, and limited generalization persist.

\subsection{Federated Learning with Mixture-of-Experts}
Federated Learning (FL) integrated with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) addresses key challenges of heterogeneity, scalability, and personalization in decentralized machine learning. Zec et al. \cite{fed-moe-1} introduced a hybrid FL framework combining global models and local experts through gating, balancing generalization and personalization on non-IID data. FedMix \cite{fedmix} extended this by employing client-specific gating to better align local gradients and enhance generalization. FedMoE-DA \cite{fedmoe-da} further advanced this by enabling dynamic expert routing between clients, boosting communication efficiency and cross-client learning.

For enhanced personalization, pFedMoE \cite{pfedmoe} integrated dual-path local-global feature extractors with adaptive expert selection. Fed-ZERO \cite{fed-zero} addressed unseen clients through zero-shot personalization, dynamically selecting relevant experts without client-specific tuning. Parsaeefard et al. \cite{robust-flmoe} enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks by filtering poisoned models using weighted softmax aggregation.

Domain-specific applications of FL-MoE include medical imaging, where Bai et al. \cite{flmoe-mri} utilized weighted aggregation to handle domain shifts across hospitals, and dFLMoE \cite{dflmoe} developed a decentralized, privacy-preserving framework using knowledge distillation and DAG-based training. In smart energy forecasting, Sievers et al. \cite{flmoe-energy} applied FL-MoE to geographically diverse datasets.

Architectural innovations have expanded FL-MoE’s versatility. Mei et al. \cite{fedmoe} proposed sparse expert selection frameworks tailored for transformers, enhancing scalability. Luo et al. \cite{flmoe-vision} extended MoE to personalized prompt learning in federated vision-language tasks, significantly improving multimodal performance. FtMoE \cite{ftmoe} introduced federated transfer MoE for heterogeneous image classification, adapting expert assignments based on task similarities.

\subsection{Handling Concept Drift and Class Imbalance in FL}
FL faces significant challenges from concept drift, temporal shifts in data distribution, and class imbalance, where certain classes are underrepresented across clients. These issues compromise model generalization and require tailored strategies.

Concept drift mitigation in FL has seen diverse approaches. Tsiporkova et al. \cite{handling-concept-drift-tsiporkova} proposed a dynamic model repository for adaptive reuse under shifting distributions. Rahimli et al. \cite{handling-concept-drift-rahimli} analyzed the separate impacts of data and concept drift, while Saile et al. \cite{handling-concept-drift-finn} introduced client-side adaptation to handle drift without centralized coordination. Xu et al. \cite{handling-concept-drift-xu} addressed drift at the sample level via FedBSS, a bias-aware training schedule, and Saadati et al. \cite{pmixfed} developed pMixFed, which leverages mixup to manage personalization and client drift.

Class imbalance has been tackled using both data-level and model-level strategies. Manjunath et al. \cite{handling-imbalance-manjunath} employed SMOTE in a federated healthcare setting to oversample minority classes. Hamidi et al. \cite{fed-it} proposed Fed-IT, an information-theoretic aggregation framework, while Racha \cite{handling-imbalance-racha} designed a co-distillation method to balance class influence across decentralized clients.

Several works jointly address both drift and imbalance. Khademi Nori et al. \cite{handling-imbalance-nori} addressed concept drift via task emergence and class imbalance through hybrid rehearsal techniques. Lee et al. \cite{handling-drift-imbalance-lee} introduced class-wise MixUp/AugMix augmentation for better minority class learning and implicit drift resilience. Kruijssen et al. \cite{handling-drift-imbalance-kruijssen} optimized reward-weight mappings for learning stability in dynamic settings. Additionally, Shen et al. \cite{handling-drift-imbalance-shen}, Deepa et al. \cite{handling-drift-imbalance-deepa}, and Zhang et al. \cite{handling-drift-imbalance-zhang} contributed ensemble-based and active learning models tailored for evolving, imbalanced data streams.

\section{Preliminaries}
\subsection{Federated Learning (FL)}
FL is a decentralized paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without exposing their raw data~\cite{mcmahan2017communication}. Each client $c_k$ holds a private dataset $\mathcal{D}_k$ and performs local updates to a shared model parameters $\theta$, which are then aggregated by a central server. The global objective is to minimize the weighted sum of local loss functions as expressed in \eqref{eq-global-loss}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq-global-loss}
	\min_{\theta} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{|\mathcal{D}_k|}{|\mathcal{D}|} \mathcal{L}_k(\theta),
\end{equation}
where $|\mathcal{D}_k|$ and $|\mathcal{D}|$ are the total number of samples with client $k$ and across all clients, respectively and $K$ is the total number of participating clients.

\subsection{Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)}
MoE is a modular neural architecture designed to improve model capacity and specialization while maintaining computational efficiency~\cite{shazeer2017outrageously}. It consists of a collection of expert subnetworks and a gating mechanism that routes each input to a subset of these experts, enabling sparse activation and dynamic inference. Given an input $x$, the output of an MoE layer is a weighted combination of the top-\(k\) selected experts:
\[
\text{MoE}(x) = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} g_i(x) \cdot E_i(x),
\]
where $\mathcal{S}$ denotes the set of selected experts, $g_i(x)$ is the gating score, and $E_i(x)$ is the output of expert $i$.

\subsection{Differential Privacy (DP)}
In the context of federated learning, DP is a privacy-enhancing technique employed to ensure that model updates do not leak private information from any client's local dataset. A randomized algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ is said to satisfy $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy if, for any two neighboring datasets $ \mathcal{D} $ and $\mathcal{D}'$ differing by at most one sample, and for any subset of outputs $S$ as defined in \eqref{eq:dp}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:dp}
	\mathbb{P}[\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{D}) \in S] \leq e^{\varepsilon} \cdot \mathbb{P}[\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{D}') \in S] + \delta,
\end{equation}
where \( \varepsilon \) measures the privacy loss and \( \delta \) accounts for a small probability of failure. The DP is implemented by injecting zero-mean Gaussian noise into the clipped local gradient before sending it to the server as expressed in \eqref{eq:dp-noise}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:dp-noise} 
	\widetilde{\Delta}_k = \text{clip}(\nabla \mathcal{L}_k, C) + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I),
\end{equation}
where $\widetilde{\Delta}_k$ is the DP preserved local update for client $k$, $C$ is the clipping bound to limit sensitivity, and $\sigma$ controls the noise scale.

\section{Threat Model}
We consider a \textit{semi‐honest} adversary in our federated encrypted traffic classification setup, where a central server orchestrates a hierarchical MoE across distributed clients. The adversary may corrupt some clients or observe aggregated updates. Such an adversary has full knowledge of our GShard Transformer backbone, hierarchical MoE gating logic, PPO policy network, hyperparameters (including drift thresholds, gating dimensions, and clipping norms), and even the differential-privacy noise distribution, but never accesses raw packet data or internal client states. Its objectives include: (1) inferring properties of individual flows or rare attack classes by analyzing expert- and gate-parameter updates and confidence summaries, (2) mounting membership-inference attacks to determine whether specific flows were used in training, and (3) reconstructing feature vectors and tracking drift events through routing and lifecycle decisions.

To mitigate these risks, each client applies DP‐SGD by clipping expert and gate updates to norm \(C\), adding Gaussian noise \(\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2C^2I)\), and accounting for \((\varepsilon,\delta)\) via a Moments Accountant (MA). Noisy updates are shared only under secure aggregation, and confidence leaks are limited to smoothed class‐level scores. Global drift thresholds are updated sparingly to avoid revealing local drift events. Together, differential privacy, secure aggregation, constrained confidence reporting, and threshold obfuscation prevent adversaries from inferring sensitive traffic patterns, client membership, or concept-drift behavior from model updates.


%\section{Threat Model}
%We consider a federated learning system for encrypted traffic classification that includes a central server, distributed clients, and a hierarchical MoE model. Each client holds private encrypted data and trains a subset of experts using drift-adaptive and imbalance-aware expert routing. Since encrypted traffic can still reveal behavioral patterns, we define a threat model that captures both privacy and security risks.
%
%We assume a \textit{semi-honest} adversary that may compromise a subset of clients or observe the server's aggregated updates, yet follows the protocol without tampering. Such an adversary has full knowledge of our GShard Transformer backbone, hierarchical MoE gating logic, PPO policy network, hyperparameters (including drift thresholds, gating dimensions, and clipping norms), and even the differential-privacy noise distribution, but never sees raw packet data or each client's internal state. Its goals include: (1) inferring properties of individual flows or rare attack classes by analyzing expert- and gate-parameter updates and confidence summaries, (2) mounting membership-inference attacks to determine whether specific flows were used in training, and (3) reconstructing feature vectors and tracking drift events through routing and lifecycle decisions.
%
%Each client defends privacy by clipping expert and gate updates to a fixed norm \(C\), adding Gaussian noise \(\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2C^2I)\), and tracking \((\varepsilon,\delta)\) loss via a Moments Accountant (MA). Only these noisy, clipped updates are shared under secure aggregation, preventing the server from isolating individual contributions. Confidence leaks are further limited by transmitting only smoothed, class-level scores instead of per-sample entropies, and global drift thresholds are broadcast infrequently to avoid revealing local drift events. Together, differential privacy, secure aggregation, constrained confidence reporting, and threshold obfuscation prevent adversaries from inferring sensitive traffic patterns, membership, or drift behavior from model updates.

\section{Method}
\subsection{Problem Formulation}
In a federated encrypted traffic classification problem, we consider \(K\) clients and a central server.  Client \(k\) holds a private dataset \(\mathcal{D}_k^t\) at round $t$, sampled from a joint distribution \(P_k^t(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})\) over encrypted‐flow features \(\mathcal{X}\in\mathbb{R}^d\) and labels \(\mathcal{Y}\in\{1,\dots,C\}\). The objective is to learn model parameters \(\theta\) of a mixture‐of‐experts classifier:
\[
f_\theta(x) \;=\;\sum_{j=1}^M g_j(x)\,E_j(x)
\]
by minimizing the federated empirical risk:
\[
\min_\theta\;\sum_{k=1}^K \frac{|\mathcal{D}_k^t|}{\sum_\ell|\mathcal{D}_\ell^t|}\;\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim\mathcal{D}_k^t}\bigl[\ell\bigl(f_\theta(x),y\bigr)\bigr]
\]

In real‐world traffic, conditional distribution \(P_k(\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{X})\), feature marginal \(P_k(\mathcal{X})\), label marginal \(P_k(\mathcal{Y})\) often evolves over time, a phenomenon known as \emph{drift}. Formally, at round \(t\), $P_k^{(t)}(\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{X})\;\neq\;P_k^{(t-1)}(\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{X}) \wedge P_k^{(t)}(\mathcal{X}) \neq P_k^{(t-1)}(\mathcal{X}) \wedge P_k^{(t)}(\mathcal{Y}) \neq P_k^{(t-1)}(\mathcal{Y})$. Moreover, in a federated setting different clients may experience distinct drifts, $P_i^{(t)}(\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{X})\;\neq\;P_j^{(t-1)}(\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{X}) \wedge P_i^{(t)}(\mathcal{X}) \neq P_j^{(t-1)}(\mathcal{X}) \wedge P_i^{(t)}(\mathcal{Y}) \neq P_j^{(t-1)}(\mathcal{Y}) \text{ for } i \neq j$, which we refer to as \emph{distributed drift}.
A robust federated classifier must therefore adapt to these three distributed drifts simultaneously across time and client.









%We consider a federated network-traffic classification problem involving \(K\) clients, each holding a local dataset \(\mathcal{D}_k^t\) at communication round \(t\). Every sample \((x,y)\in\mathcal{D}_k^t\) consists of an encrypted-flow feature vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\) and its label \(y\in\{1,\dots,C\}\). The marginal distribution \(P_k^t(x,y)\) from which \(\mathcal{D}_k^t\) is drawn may drift over time, reflecting new applications, adversarial evasions, or shifting user behaviors, and is often severely skewed, with benign traffic dominating rare but critical attack classes. Our goal is to learn the parameters \(\theta\) of a global mixture-of-experts classifier:
%\[
%f_\theta(x) = \sum_{j=1}^M g_j(x)\,e_j(x),
%\]
%by minimizing the federated empirical risk:
%\[
%\min_\theta
%\sum_{k=1}^K \frac{|\mathcal{D}_k^t|}{\sum_{\ell=1}^K |\mathcal{D}_\ell^t|}
%\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim \mathcal{D}_k^t}
%\bigl[\ell\bigl(f_\theta(x),y\bigr)\bigr]
%\]
%
%We quantify distributed concept drift at client \(k\) via a per-sample drift score \(d_k(x)\), which measures deviation from historical feature–label statistics. Class imbalance at client \(k\) is measured by the imbalance ratio
%\[
%\mathrm{IR}_k = 
%\frac{
%	\max_{c}\bigl|\{(x,y)\in\mathcal{D}_k^t : y=c\}\bigr|
%}{
%	\min_{c}\bigl|\{(x,y)\in\mathcal{D}_k^t : y=c\}\bigr|
%}
%\]
%
%A robust solution must (1) adaptively route samples based on \(d_k(x)\) to specialized experts for stable or drifting patterns, (2) incorporate class-sensitive loss weights to emphasize under-represented labels, and (3) dynamically adjust the expert pool to match the evolving complexity of the data.




\subsection{Overview of DAIR-FedMoE Framework}
The overall workflow of DAIR-FedMoE, built upon a GShard transformer backbone, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-model}.
DAIR-FedMoE extends a GShard Transformer by embedding drift-aware expert trees and confidence-guided loss reweighting into MoE layer. In each federated round, the server broadcasts latest expert shards, gating networks and global confidence coefficients to all clients. Each client then detects local concept drift on its encrypted-flow data, routes inputs to either stable or drift experts, and trains experts using class-confidence weights. During local training, each expert maintains a running average of its softmax entropy to estimate class confidence. Clients convert these scores into weights for the cross-entropy loss, up-weighting rare or uncertain classes to handle class imbalance, and backpropagate gradients through both the experts and the gating networks. After local updates, clients performs differential privacy and return updated parameters and revised confidence summaries back to the server, which aggregates them via weighted FedAvg. Moreover, a reinforcement learning-based policy network on the server monitors expert utilization and drift trends to manage the life cycle of experts and to keep capacity aligned with evolving data. This seamless integration of a GShard transformer backbone, drift-aware routing, confidence-guided loss reweighting and RL-managed expert lifecycle underpins the adaptability and robustness of DAIR-FedMoE in handling label concept drift and class imbalance simultaneously.  


%The overall workflow of DAIR-FedMoE, built upon a GShard Transformer backbone, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-model}. At the start of each federated round, the server broadcasts the latest expert parameters, gating networks and global confidence coefficients to all clients. Upon receipt, each client tokenizes its encrypted‐flow sessions into embeddings augmented with sinusoidal positional encodings, then computes a lightweight per-sample drift score to quantify shifts from the client's historical distribution. These drift scores are concatenated with the token embeddings and passed through a stack of Transformer blocks, each comprising multi-head self-attention, the HMoE sublayer (whose two-tier gate routes tokens based on drift score to stable or drift-specialist experts), and a feed-forward network, with residual connections and layer normalization ensuring stable training. During local training, each expert \(E_j\) tracks class-wise confidence \(\phi_{j,c}\) via an exponential moving average of softmax entropies; clients translate these into weights \(w_{j,c}=1/(\phi_{j,c}+\varepsilon)\) that up-weight under-represented or low-confidence classes in the cross-entropy loss, and backpropagate gradients through both experts and gating networks. After completing its local epochs, each client returns expert weight deltas, gate updates and updated \(\{\phi_{j,c}\}\) to the server, which aggregates them via a weighted FedAvg scheme—updating drift experts only from high-drift clients—and refreshes the global confidence statistics. Finally, a reinforcement-learning policy network observes the current state (expert utilization, drift engagement, confidence profiles and recent performance deltas) and executes a lifecycle action (Prune, Spawn, Merge or NoOp) to dynamically adjust the expert pool before the next round. This seamless integration of a GShard Transformer backbone, drift-aware routing, confidence-guided loss reweighting and RL-managed expert lifecycle underpins the adaptability and robustness of DAIR-FedMoE.  



%\subsection{Overview of DAIR-FedMoE Framework}
%Figure~\ref{fig-model} illustrates the overall workflow of the proposed DAIR-FedMoE framework. At each federated communication round, the server begins by broadcasting the current parameters of all expert networks and the associated gating models to every client. Upon reception, each client processes its local encrypted-flow data in three sequential stages.
%
%First, a lightweight drift detector computes a per-sample score \(d_k(\mathbf{x})\) that quantifies deviation from the client's historical distribution. These scores, together with the feature embedding \(h(\mathbf{x})\), are fed into a two-tier gating hierarchy. The \emph{root gate} produces routing probabilities for the ``stable'' versus ``drift'' regimes; regime-specific gates then select one of the corresponding expert networks to classify the sample.
%
%Second, during local training, each expert \(E_j\) maintains class-wise confidence estimates \(\phi_{j,c}\) derived from an exponential moving average of softmax entropies. The client uses these confidence values to compute per-class weights $w_{j,c} = 1/(\phi_{j,c} + \varepsilon)$ and applies them in the cross-entropy loss to up-weight under-represented or low-confidence classes. Gradients flow through both the chosen expert and its upstream gating networks.
%
%Third, after local updates are completed, each client returns expert weight deltas, gating model updates, and updated confidence summaries \(\{\phi_{j,c}\}\) to the server. The server aggregates these using a weighted FedAvg scheme, drift experts are updated only by clients exhibiting high average drift, then incorporates the new confidence statistics into the global state.
%
%Finally, an RL-based policy network on the server observes the current ``state'' (expert utilization rates, drift engagement, confidence profiles, and recent performance deltas) and selects a lifecycle action \(a_t\in\{\texttt{Prune},\texttt{Spawn},\texttt{Merge},\texttt{NoOp}\}\). Executing this action dynamically adjusts the set of active experts before the next round begins, ensuring that model capacity evolves with the data. This tight integration of drift-aware routing, confidence-guided loss reweighting, and reinforced expert management forms the backbone of DAIR-FedMoE.



\subsection{GShard Transformer Backbone}
The DAIR-FedMoE framework is built on the GShard transformer architecture of Lepikhin et al. \cite{gshard}. We replace each standard MoE layer with our hierarchical MoE (HMoE) layer, yielding a sparse, drift-aware attention network. Each encrypted-flow session $x$ is first tokenized into a sequence of embeddings enriched with sinusoidal positional encodings, after which these representations traverse a stack of $L$ transformer blocks. Within each block, multi-head self-attention is applied to the tokens, followed by the HMoE layer where a two-tier gating mechanism guided by per-token drift scores routes tokens to either stable experts or drift-specialist experts. The updated embeddings entering the HMoE layer are denoted by $h$. After routing and expert processing, these outputs pass through a standard feed-forward network. Furthermore, residual connections and layer normalization follow every sublayer to ensure stable training at scale, and the final representation of the \texttt{[CLS]} token is fed into a two-layer MLP classification head with a softmax output to produce the class logits. In each communication round \(t\), the GShard transformer is partitioned into shards, with client \(k\) receiving \(\text{Shard}_k\).



%\medskip
%\noindent\textbf{Integration with DAIR-FedMoE.} Because drift scoring and confidence-based reweighting (Secs.~3.3 and 3.4) now operate at the token level, we have revised the gating network design (Sec.~3.3.2) to accept per-token drift inputs \(\tilde d_k(x_i)\) rather than per-flow aggregates. Likewise, expert network architectures (Sec.~3.3.4) are now implemented as lightweight Transformer feed-forward blocks, sharing the same dimensionality \(d_h\) as the attention heads.
%
%\medskip
%\noindent\textbf{Recommended Method Section Updates.}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item In Sec.~3.2, update the architectural pipeline figure and description to show alternating Transformer and HMoE sublayers.
%	\item In Sec.~3.3.2 and 3.3.3, clarify that gating decisions are made per token (rather than per sample) and aggregate to form a flow-level routing decision if desired.
%	\item In Sec.~3.3.4, replace the two‐layer MLP expert definition with a Transformer feed-forward block of dimension \(d_h\) and expansion factor \(\nu\).
%	\item In Sec.~3.6, note that each client's local update uses backpropagation through both attention and HMoE layers.
%\end{itemize}


%\subsection{GShard Transformer Backbone}
%We build our DAIR-FedMoE framework upon the GShard Transformer architecture introduced by Lepikhin et al.~\cite{gshard}. In our implementation, the standard MoE layer is replaced with the proposed hierarchitcal MoE (HMoE) layer. Each session input $x$ is first transformed into token embeddings augmented with positional encodings. These embeddings are then passed through a sequence of interleaved multi-head self-attention modules and sparse HMoE sublayers. A two-tier gating network dynamically routes each token to a selected regime gate based on drift score. Finally, the selected regeme gate further routes the input to specific expert, enabling efficient computation while maintaining high model capacity. Residual connections with layer normalization are applied after each sublayer to ensure stable training. Finally, an MLP classification head with Softmax layer classifies the \texttt{[CLS]} token.

\subsection{Hierarchical Mixture‐of‐Experts (HMoE) layer}
In DAIR-FedMoE, the HMoE layer groups experts into two regimes, stable and drift, and uses a two-level gating mechanism to route encrypted-flow samples. Each sample is first assigned a drift score and sent to the root gate, which chooses between the stable or drift regime. A second, regime-specific gate then selects the specialist expert within that regime. This two-tier structure isolates evolving traffic patterns for rapid adaptation while preserving stable behavior.

\noindent \textbf{Local Drift Detection Mechanism.} To support the top‐level routing in our expert tree, each client computes a \emph{local drift score} for every incoming feature vector. This score quantifies how much the current encrypted‐flow distribution has shifted relative to historical observations, allowing the model to distinguish between consistent and drifting traffic before classification.

At each communication round \(t\), client \(k\) first evaluates a drift score \(d_k(h)\) for each encrypted‐flow feature vector embedding $h$. This score measures the divergence between two empirical feature distributions over a sliding window of size \(W\), as given in \eqref{eq:distribution-history} and \eqref{eq:distribution-current}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:distribution-history}
	P_k^{t,\mathrm{hist}} \;=\; \frac{1}{W}\sum_{s=t-W}^{t-1} \mathbb{E}_{h\sim \mathcal{D}_k^s}\bigl[\delta(h)\bigr]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:distribution-current}
	P_k^{t,\mathrm{curr}} \;=\; \mathbb{E}_{h\sim \mathcal{D}_k^t}\bigl[\delta(h)\bigr],
\end{equation}
where \(\delta(h)\) denotes the Dirac mass at \(h\). We employ the Jensen–Shannon divergence to quantify the shift, as expressed in \eqref{eq:drift}.
\begin{flalign}
	\label{eq:drift}
	\begin{aligned}
		d_k(h) &= \mathrm{JS}\bigl(P_k^{t,\mathrm{curr}}\|P_k^{t,\mathrm{hist}}\bigr) \\
		&=\tfrac12\,\mathrm{KL}\bigl(P_k^{t,\mathrm{curr}}\|M\bigr)
		+\tfrac12\,\mathrm{KL}\bigl(P_k^{t,\mathrm{hist}}\|M\bigr),
	\end{aligned}
\end{flalign}
with \(M = \tfrac12(P_k^{t,\mathrm{curr}} + P_k^{t,\mathrm{hist}})\). In practice, both distributions are estimated via Gaussian kernel density estimates over packet payload to ensure efficiency on edge devices. To reduce noise in the drift score, we further employ exponential smoothing as defined in \eqref{eq:noise}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:noise}
	\tilde d_k(h) \;=\; \alpha\,\tilde d_k^{\,t-1}(h)
	\;+\;(1-\alpha)\,d_k(h),
\end{equation}
where \(\alpha\in[0.9,0.99]\) is a smoothing factor. The normalized score \(\tilde d_k(h)\) is then concatenated with the feature embedding \(h\) and fed into the root gating network. Samples with high \(\tilde d_k(h)\) are routed to drift‐specialist experts, while those with low scores proceed to stable experts, forming the foundation of our hierarchical MoE.

\noindent \textbf{Root Gating Network Design.} The root gating network is responsible for determining whether an input sample should be routed through stable or drift experts. It takes as input the feature embedding \(h\in\mathbb{R}^{d_k}\) of the encrypted‐flow vector and the normalized drift score \(\tilde d_k(h)\in[0,1]\), where ${d_k}$ is the embedding dimension. These are concatenated into the vector, as defined in \eqref{eq:concar-vector}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:concar-vector}
	z = \begin{bmatrix}h \\ \tilde d_k(h)\end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_k+1}
\end{equation}

This vector is then passed through a two‐layer multilayer perceptron to produce routing probabilities $r = [r_\text{stable},r_\text{drift}]$. Here \(r_\text{stable}\) and \(r_\text{drift}\) denote the probabilities of routing to the stable or drift regime, respectively. The root gate's parameters are updated jointly with all other components via backpropagation through the hierarchical MoE loss.  


\noindent \textbf{Stable vs. Drift-Specialist Expert Routing.} After computing root gate probabilities \(r\), each sample follows the branch with higher probability. If \(r_\text{stable}\ge r_\text{drift}\), the feature embedding \(h\) is passed to the stable‐regime gate; otherwise it goes to the drift‐regime gate. Each regime gate then applies a softmax over its subset of experts as defined in \eqref{eq:softmax-stable} and \eqref{eq:softmax-drift}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:softmax-stable}
	g^S = \mathrm{softmax}(W_sh + b_s)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:softmax-drift}
	g^D = \mathrm{softmax}(W_dh + b_d),
\end{equation}
where \(g^S\in\Delta^{l-1}\) indexes \(l\) stable experts and \(g^D \in \Delta^{m-1}\) indexes \(m\) drift experts. Here, $W_s, W_d$ and $b_s, b_d$ are the corresponding weights and biases. A hard routing selects expert \(j^* = \arg\max_j g^r_j\). This two‐tier routing ensures that stable patterns are isolated from evolving traffic behaviors.

\noindent \textbf{Expert Network Architectures.} Each expert \(E_j\) is a lightweight classifier mapping \(h\in\mathbb{R}^{d_k}\) to class logits in \(\mathbb{R}^C\). In our implementation, all experts share a uniform two‐layer fully‐connected architecture followed by a softmax to obtain class probabilities. Dropout and batch normalization layers are used in between for regularization. Although stable and drift experts use the same architecture, their parameters are updated using different client‐data subsets as determined by the hierarchical routing mechanism. 

\subsection{Adaptive Loss Reweighting via Expert Confidence}
To mitigate class imbalance within each expert, we introduce an adaptive loss reweighting mechanism that leverages per-class confidence estimates. By dynamically scaling the contribution of each class to the loss function according to the expert's certainty, under-represented or difficult classes receive additional emphasis, improving the model's ability to correctly classify minority categories.

\noindent \textbf{Per-Expert Confidence Estimation.} For each expert \(E_j\), we first compute the predictive distribution \(p_j(h)\in\Delta^{C-1}\) over \(C\) classes for samples \(h\) routed to that expert. The per-sample Shannon entropy $H_j(h)$ quantifies the expert's uncertainty as expressed in \eqref{eq:shanon-entropy}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:shanon-entropy}
	H_j(h) \;=\; -\sum_{c=1}^C p_j(h)_c \,\log p_j(h)_c
\end{equation}

To derive class-specific statistics, we average these entropies over a sliding window of the most recent samples \(\mathcal{B}_{j,c}\) with true label \(c\) defined as in \eqref{eq:class-specif-stats}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:class-specif-stats}
	\overline{H}_{j,c} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{B}_{j,c}|} \sum_{h \in \mathcal{B}_{j,c}} H_j(h)
\end{equation}

We then update an exponential moving average (EMA) of these values to smooth temporal fluctuations, as given by \eqref{eq:ema-smooting}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ema-smooting}
	\tilde H_{j,c}^{\,(t)} \;=\; \alpha\,\tilde H_{j,c}^{\,(t-1)}
	\;+\;(1-\alpha)\,\overline H_{j,c},
\end{equation}
where \(\alpha\in[0.9,0.99]\) is a smoothing factor. Finally, we normalize the EMA-entropy scores into a confidence coefficient $\phi_{j,c}$ in \([0,1]\) as computed in \eqref{eq:ema-entropy-normalize}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ema-entropy-normalize}
	\phi_{j,c} = 1-\frac{\tilde H_{j,c}}{\max_{c'} \tilde H_{j,c'}}
\end{equation}

A lower \(\phi_{j,c}\) indicates that expert \(E_j\) is less certain on class \(c\), directing subsequent loss reweighting to prioritize that class. These confidence values \(\{\phi_{j,c}\}\) are communicated to the server alongside model updates and are used in the next step to compute class-wise loss weights.

\noindent \textbf{Entropy-Based Weight Computation.} Given the smoothed confidence coefficients \(\phi_{j,c}\in[0,1]\) for expert \(E_j\) and class \(c\), we derive per-class weights $w_{j,c}$ by inverting confidence, as defined in \eqref{eq:entropy-weight}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:entropy-weight}
	w_{j,c} = \frac{1}{\phi_{j,c} + \varepsilon},
\end{equation}
where \(\varepsilon>0\) is a small constant to prevent division by zero. Intuitively, lower confidence \(\phi_{j,c}\) yields higher weight \(w_{j,c}\), thus emphasizing harder or under-represented classes. To avoid extreme values that could destabilize training, we clip \(w_{j,c}\) into a bounded interval \([\omega_{\min}, \omega_{\max}]\).

\noindent \textbf{Incorporation into Local Loss Function.} During each client's local update, routed samples \((x_i, y_i)\) assigned to expert \(E_j\) incur a weighted cross-entropy loss, as defined in \eqref{eq:weighted-ce-loss}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:weighted-ce-loss}
	\mathcal L_k \;=\; \frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}_k|}\sum_{(h_i,y_i)\in\mathcal{D}_k}
	w_{j,y_i}\;\ell\bigl(E_j(h),\,y_i\bigr),
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{D}_k$ is the local dataset at client $k$, \(w_{j,y_i}\) is the weight for the true label \(y_i\), and $h$ is the embedding for feature $x_i$. Gradients computed from \(\mathcal L_k\) backpropagate through both the expert network \(E_j\) and its upstream gating modules, ensuring that high‐weight (low‐confidence) classes receive proportionally greater parameter updates.

To enforce differential privacy, each client applies DP to its local parameter deltas as defined by \eqref{eq:dp-noise}. The same procedure is applied to the gating updates \(\Delta G_\cdot^{(k)}\).  Only the privatized updates \(\{\tilde \Delta E_j^{(k)}, \tilde\Delta G_\cdot^{(k)}\}\) and the updated confidence summaries are transmitted to the server.



\subsection{RL-Based Expert Lifecycle Management}
In DAIR-FedMoE, the server employs a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to manage the set of active experts so that model capacity continuously aligns with evolving traffic patterns, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-policy-architecture}. This includes, pruning under‐utilized networks, spawning new drift specialists, and merging redundant experts. We formalize this as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train a lightweight policy network to optimize long‐term classification performance and resource efficiency. We define the MDP at federated round \(t\) as follows:

\noindent \textbf{State \(s_t\):} 
A real‐valued vector concatenating:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Expert utilization rates} \(\{\bar u_j\}_{j=1}^M\), where \(\bar u_j\) is the average gating probability of expert \(j\) over the past \(R\) rounds.
	\item \emph{Drift engagement} \(\{\delta_j\}\), the fraction of samples routed to each drift expert versus stable experts.
	\item \emph{Confidence profiles} \(\{\phi_{j,c}\}\) averaged across classes.
	\item \emph{Performance deltas} \(\Delta\mathrm{F1}_t\) and \(\Delta\mathrm{DR}_t\), the changes in macro‐F1 and drift‐recovery speed between rounds \(t-1\) and \(t\).
	\item \emph{Expert ages} \(\{a_j\}\), the number of rounds since each expert was created or last merged.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Action \(a_t\):} 
A discrete choice from the set $\mathcal A = \{\texttt{Prune}(j),\;\texttt{Spawn}(k),\;\texttt{Merge}(j_1,j_2),\;\texttt{NoOp}\},$ where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \(\texttt{Prune}(j)\) removes expert \(j\).
	\item \(\texttt{Spawn}(k)\) creates a new drift expert initialized from drift‐cluster centroid \(k\).
	\item \(\texttt{Merge}(j_1,j_2)\) combines experts \(j_1\) and \(j_2\) by averaging their weights.
	\item \(\texttt{NoOp}\) leaves the expert pool unchanged.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Reward \(r_t\):} 
We craft a scalar reward $r_t$ balancing classification gains and model complexity as defined in \eqref{eq:reward}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:reward}
	r_t = \Delta\mathrm{F1}_t + \lambda_d \Delta\mathrm{DR}_t - \mu |\Delta M_t|,
\end{equation}
where \(\Delta M_t\) is the change in total expert count, and \(\lambda_d,\mu>0\) weight the drift‐recovery improvement and expert‐count penalty.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{fig-policy-architecture}
	\caption{RL-based expert life cycle management policy network architecture.}
	\label{fig-policy-architecture}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{Policy Network Architecture.} We implement a shared actor–critic network that processes the MDP state \(s_t\) through two hidden layers. From the second layer, the policy head produces action probabilities $\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)$ and the value head estimates the state value $V_\phi(s_t)$. The policy parameters are denoted by \(\theta\) and the value parameters by \(\phi\).

%\noindent \textbf{Training and Update Schedule.} 
During each federated round, the server collects transitions \((s_t,a_t,r_t,s_{t+1},\log\pi_{\theta_\text{old}}(a_t|s_t))\) into an replay buffer. Every \(U\) rounds, the policy is updated using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) clipped‐surrogate objective. For each sampled minibatch, we compute the advantage estimates \(\hat A_t = \hat R_t - V_\phi(s_t)\), where \(\hat R_t\) are the empirical returns. The actor is trained by minimizing objective function as defined in \eqref{eq:ppo-objective}, while the critic is trained by minimizing the value‐function loss as expressed in \eqref{eq:value-loss}.
\begin{flalign}
	\label{eq:ppo-objective}
	\begin{aligned}
		L^{\text{PPO}}(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}[&\min(\hat{A}_t \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) / {\pi_{\theta_\text{old}}(a_t|s_t)}, \\
		&\text{clip}(r_t(\theta),1-\epsilon,1+\epsilon)\,\hat A_t)]
	\end{aligned}
\end{flalign}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:value-loss}
	L^{\text{VF}}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}[(V_\phi(s_t)-\hat R_t)^2]
\end{equation}
 
Further to encourage exploration, we add an entropy bonus \(L^{\text{ent}} = -\mathbb{E}[H(\pi_\theta(\cdot|s_t))]\). We perform \(N_{\text{PPO}}\) epochs of gradient descent on the combined loss, as expressed in \eqref{eq:total-loss}, using separate learning rates for actor and critic. After updating, we set \(\theta_\text{old}\leftarrow\theta\) before the next optimization cycle.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:total-loss}
	L = L^{\text{PPO}} + c_{\text{vf}}\,L^{\text{VF}} + c_{\text{ent}}L^{\text{ent}},
\end{equation}    
where \(c_{\text{vf}}>0\) and \(c_{\text{ent}}>0\) scale the value‐function loss and entropy bonus, respectively. After completing the PPO updates, we set \(\theta_{\mathrm{old}}\leftarrow\theta\) before the next optimization cycle.
































%\noindent \textbf{Policy Network Architecture.} The policy network \(\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)\) is parameterized by $\theta$ as a two-layer fully connected neural network. It network outputs a probability distribution over \(\mathcal A\), from which \(a_t\) is sampled. To ensure stability and prevent pathological expert configurations, we impose:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \emph{Expert count bounds:} Maintain \(M_{\min}\le M_t\le M_{\max}\). Actions violating these bounds are masked out.
%	\item \emph{Restricted merges/spawns:} Merges are limited to the two least‐utilized experts, and spawns only from the top-\(K\) drift clusters.
%	\item \(\varepsilon\)-\emph{greedy exploration:} With probability \(\varepsilon_t\) the agent selects a random valid action; \(\varepsilon_t\) decays over time to favor exploitation.
%\end{itemize}
%
%%\noindent \textbf{Training and Update Schedule.}
%We treat each federated round as a timestep in the RL episode. The agent collects transitions \((s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})\) into a replay buffer. Policy updates occur every \(U\) rounds using the REINFORCE algorithm. The gradient are calculated as in \eqref{eq:policy-gradients}.
%\begin{equation}
%	\label{eq:policy-gradients}
%	\nabla_\theta J = \mathbb{E} [(r_t - b_t)\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)],
%\end{equation}
%where \(b_t\) is an exponential moving average of past rewards. We use a discount factor \(\gamma\in[0.9,0.99]\), learning rate \(\eta\), and mini‐batch sampling from the buffer to stabilize training. An initial warm‐start period of \(T_0\) rounds uses heuristic lifecycle rules before enabling RL control, ensuring sufficient experience for policy learning.

\subsection{Federated Training Protocol}
This section details the iterative protocol by which DAIR-FedMoE orchestrates communication and learning between the server and clients over federated rounds. Each round comprises three phases: broadcast, local update, and aggregation with policy invocation, as detailed in Algorithm \ref{alg:train_round}.

At round \(t\), the server first broadcasts the current expert parameters, gating networks, and global confidence coefficients to all participating clients. Each client \(k\) then computes drift score for every sample \((h,y)\) and smooths it into \(\tilde d_k(h)\). Next, the smooth score is feed into the root gate, which outputs probabilities for the stable and drift regimes; the sample follows the higher‐probability path to the corresponding regime gate and ultimately to its assigned experts. For each expert \(E_j\) that processed the sample, the client calculates the predictive entropy, updates the EMA of that entropy, derives the class confidence, and computes the clipped weight \(w_{j,y}\). The client further accumulates the weighted cross‐entropy losses and backpropagates through \(E_j\) and the gating networks to produce local parameter updates. These updates are then applied DP and sent back to the server. After collecting updates from a subset of clients \(\mathcal{S}_t\), the server finally aggregates them, updates its global state, and invokes the RL policy to adjust the expert pool before commencing the next round.

\section{Experimental Details}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
%Feature extraction is performed on each client without inspecting packet payloads. For every unidirectional flow, we compute statistical descriptors over packet sizes (minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, quartiles), inter‐arrival times, total byte and packet counts, flow duration, and TCP header flag counts (e.g.\ SYN, FIN). To capture temporal variability, we include histogram quantiles of packet lengths and inter‐arrival intervals using ten uniform bins. All features are standardized via z‐score normalization using running estimates of mean and variance.
The DAIR-FedMoE framework is implemented using PyTorch 1.12 for model construction, Flower 0.19 for federated orchestration, and Ray RLlib 1.8 for reinforcement learning. All experiments are conducted on a Windows 11 24H2 system equipped with dual NVIDIA V100 GPUs and 128 GB RAM. Clients are simulated in CPU-only Docker containers to emulate edge deployments. All source code, pretrained models, and configuration files will be publicly released.

We set the drift estimation window to $W = 500$ samples and use an EMA smoothing factor $\alpha = 0.95$. Confidence weights are clipped to the interval $[\omega_{\min}, \omega_{\max}] = [1.0, 5.0]$. The GShard Transformer backbone comprises $L = 12$ transformer blocks with hidden dimension $d_k = 512$, 8-head self-attention, and a feed-forward expansion factor of 4. Each HMoE sublayer includes $l = 4$ stable experts and $m = 4$ drift experts, each implemented as a two-layer MLP with hidden size $H_e = 512$. Gating networks use a hidden size $H_g = 128$. Clients perform 5 local epochs per round with batch size 32, using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of $10^{-3}$ for both expert and gate modules. The PPO-based policy network for expert lifecycle management has two hidden layers of size $H_p = 256$. We set the PPO clip parameter $\epsilon = 0.2$, value-function loss coefficient $c_{vf} = 0.5$, entropy bonus coefficient $c_{ent} = 0.01$, and perform $N_{\text{PPO}} = 4$ optimization epochs per update. The actor and critic use learning rates of $5 \times 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, respectively. The RL reward formulation (Eq.~\ref{eq:reward}) includes weights $\lambda_d = 2.0$ for drift-recovery improvement and $\mu = 0.5$ for expert-count regularization. These values are selected via grid search based on validation performance.

To enforce $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy, each client clips gradient norms to $C = 1.0$ and adds Gaussian noise with standard deviation $\sigma = 1.2$. The Moments Accountant tracks cumulative privacy loss, ensuring $\delta = 10^{-5}$ over $T = 200$ communication rounds.




\subsection{Baselines}
We compare DAIR-FedMoE against several representative federated learning methods. Federated Averaging (FedAvg) is the canonical algorithm for federated optimization, in which clients perform multiple local SGD steps and the server averages model parameters each round. FedProx extends FedAvg by adding a proximal term to each client's objective to improve stability under system and statistical heterogeneity. FedDrift introduces multiple local models to explicitly address distributed concept drift, using local drift detection and hierarchical clustering to spawn and merge models dynamically. FLAME employs adaptive monitoring and elimination of drifted clients in IoT‐style deployments, reacting to drift events while respecting communication and privacy constraints. FedCCFA clusters classifiers at the class level and aligns feature spaces under distributed concept drift via entropy‐based anchors, demonstrating strong adaptation to \(P(\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{X})\) shifts. FedConD addresses concept drift in asynchronous federated learning by adjusting local regularization parameters and prudent update selection on the server. In addition, we include (i) \emph{local training}, where each client trains its model independently without aggregation, and (ii) a \emph{centralized} baseline, in which all data are pooled for joint training, to bound performance.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We measure per‐class performance via the macro‐F$_1$ score, defined as the unweighted average of the \(F_1\) scores across all classes. To assess sensitivity to rare classes, we report \emph{minority‐class recall}, computed as the recall over the bottom quartile of classes by frequency. \emph{Drift‐recovery speed} is quantified as the number of communication rounds required for the macro‐F$_1$ to return to within 5\% of its pre‐drift value after a simulated drift event. We also track \emph{communication efficiency}, measured by the total number of model parameter transmissions until convergence, normalizing by the FedAvg baseline. Finally, we report standard precision and recall averages to facilitate comparison with prior work.

\subsection{Datasets and Federated Splits}
For general classification performance, we leverage three encrypted‐traffic benchmarks. The ISCX VPN‐nonVPN dataset comprises 14 traffic categories (e.g., VOIP, P2P, HTTP) captured in both VPN and non‐VPN sessions, with flow‐level statistics extracted via ISCXFlowMeter. The ISCX Tor‐nonTor dataset contains labeled PCAPs and flow features for Tor‐routed and direct traffic across 10 application classes. The VPN/Non‐VPN Network Application Traffic (VNAT) dataset comprises 165 PCAP files (82 VPN, 83 non‐VPN) spanning 10 applications, totaling 36.1 GB of encrypted and clear‐text flows.

%To evaluate drift adaptation, we use federated splits of two intrusion detection benchmarks. CIC‐IDS2017 contains benign and up‐to‐date attack traffic captured over five days, with over 80 flow‐based features generated by CICFlowMeter. UNSW‐NB15 comprises 100 GB of raw packets from IXIA PerfectStorm, featuring nine attack types (Fuzzers, DoS, Exploits, Reconnaissance, etc.) and benign traffic, with 49 extracted features per flow.



To emulate a realistic cross‐device FL environment, we partition each benchmark into \(K=20\) clients and induce statistical non‐IIDness via a symmetric Dirichlet distribution. Specifically, for each client \(i\), we sample a class‐proportion vector $\boldsymbol{\pi}_i \sim \mathrm{Dir}(\alpha)$ with concentration parameter \(\alpha = 0.5\). We then allocate samples to client \(i\) in proportion to \(\boldsymbol{\pi}_i\), ensuring each client holds roughly 3000-5000 flows. Further details are provided in Appendix.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Federated Splits}

\noindent \textit{ISCX‐VPN.} This dataset has 14 application classes. We draw \(\boldsymbol{\pi}_i\) over these 14 classes and assign flows accordingly. Each client's local store remains fixed over all federated rounds.

\noindent \textit{ISCX‐Tor.} Here there are 20 composite classes (10 applications \(\times\) 2 routing modes: Tor vs. non‐Tor). We sample a 20‐dimensional Dirichlet for each client and allocate 3000-4500 flows per client.

\noindent \textit{CIC‐IDS2017.} We first split the full capture into five chronological day‐wise segments. For each client \(i\):
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sample a day‐weight vector \(\boldsymbol{\omega}_i \sim \mathrm{Dir}(\alpha_{t})\) over the five days (\(\alpha_{t} = 0.5\)).
	\item Allocate 70\% of that client’s flows from its highest‐weight day, and distribute the remaining 30\% across the other days according to \(\boldsymbol{\omega}_i\).
	\item Within each day’s subset, apply a second Dirichlet(\(\alpha=0.5\)) over the 10 classes (benign + 9 attack types) to induce label heterogeneity.
\end{enumerate}
This produces 2500-3500 flows per client, with both spatial and temporal non‐IID characteristics.

\noindent \textit{UNSW‐NB15.} We mimic temporal drift via three equal time‐slices (early, mid, late) and nine attack + benign classes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Draw a slice‐weight vector \(\boldsymbol{\omega}_i \sim \mathrm{Dir}(\alpha_{t}=0.5)\).
	\item Assign 70\% of client \(i\)’s flows from the slice with highest weight and 30\% from the others per \(\boldsymbol{\omega}_i\).
	\item Within each slice, sample class proportions via \(\mathrm{Dirichlet}(\alpha=0.5)\) over the 10 labels.
\end{enumerate}
Each client thus holds 3000-4000 flows, capturing both label‐ and time‐based heterogeneity.


\noindent \textbf{Drift Injection Protocol.}  
To rigorously evaluate DAIR-FedMoE’s ability to detect and adapt to different types of drift, we inject controlled feature, concept, label, and combined drifts into the CIC-IDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 benchmarks at specific federated rounds. For ISCX-VPN and ISCX-Tor we retain their original distributions (no artificial drift). Specifically:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item \textbf{Feature Drift (Round $T_f=50$):}  
	We randomly select $50\%$ of clients and perturb a random 20\% subset of their feature dimensions by adding Gaussian noise  
	\[
	x' = x + \eta,\quad \eta \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_f^2),\quad \sigma_f = 0.2.
	\]
	This simulates shifts in flow characteristics (e.g., new encryption protocols).
	
	\item \textbf{Concept Drift (Round $T_c=100$):}  
	We choose a disjoint set of $50\%$ of clients and swap labels between two target classes $(c_1,c_2)$:  
	\[
	y' = 
	\begin{cases}
		c_2, & \text{if } y = c_1,\\
		c_1, & \text{if } y = c_2,\\
		y,   & \text{otherwise.}
	\end{cases}
	\]
	This models semantic shifts in application behavior.
	
	\item \textbf{Label Drift (Round $T_l = 150$):}  
	We select $30\%$ of clients and modify their local class priors by downsampling the two majority classes to 10\% of their original counts and oversampling the two minority classes to 20\%, achieving a skew factor $\beta=0.1$.  
	This emulates sudden changes in traffic volume for certain attack types.
	
	\item \textbf{Combined Drift (Round $T_{all}=200$):}  
	On \emph{all} clients, we simultaneously apply:  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Feature drift with $\sigma_f = 0.3$,
		\item Concept drift swapping a different pair of classes,
		\item Label drift with skew factor $\beta = 0.2$.
	\end{itemize}
	This stress-tests the full adaptation pipeline under co-occurring drifts.
\end{enumerate}




\noindent \textbf{Metrics:}  
We assess DAIR-FedMoE and all baselines along seven complementary dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Macro-F1 score:} the unweighted average of per-class F1 scores,  
	\[
	\mathrm{F1}_{\mathrm{macro}} = \frac{1}{C}\sum_{c=1}^{C} \frac{2\,\mathrm{Precision}_c\,\mathrm{Recall}_c}{\mathrm{Precision}_c + \mathrm{Recall}_c}\,,
	\]
	to capture overall classification quality across all classes.
	
	\item \emph{Minority-class recall:} the average recall over the bottom 25\% of classes by frequency,  
	\[
	\mathrm{Recall}_{\mathrm{minor}} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{minor}}|}\sum_{c\in \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{minor}}} \frac{\mathrm{TP}_c}{\mathrm{TP}_c + \mathrm{FN}_c}\,,
	\]
	measuring sensitivity to underrepresented or drifting labels.
	
	\item \emph{Drift-recovery speed:} number of federated rounds required for the macro-F1 to return within 5\% of its pre-drift value after a synthetic drift is injected.
	
	\item \emph{Communication efficiency:} total volume of model parameters transmitted until convergence, normalized by FedAvg:
	\[
	\mathrm{CommCost} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T} \lvert \Delta\theta^{(t)}\rvert}{\sum_{t=1}^{T_{\mathrm{FedAvg}}} \lvert \Delta\theta_{\mathrm{FedAvg}}^{(t)}\rvert}\,.
	\]
	
	\item \emph{Expert-pool dynamics:} average number of active experts per round and the cumulative number of spawn/prune/merge operations, to quantify model complexity adaptation.
	
	\item \emph{Runtime overhead:} wall-clock time per round on client and server (average over rounds), reported relative to FedAvg.
	
	\item \emph{Privacy budget consumption:} cumulative \((\varepsilon,\delta)\) due to DP-SGD noise across all rounds, verifying that \(\delta\) remains below \(10^{-5}\) by round \(T\).
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Overall Performance}

\paragraph{Macro-F1, Minority Recall, and Communication Cost.}  
Table II summarizes the overall classification quality and efficiency of DAIR-FedMoE versus all baselines on our four datasets. Across static benchmarks (ISCX-VPN, ISCX-Tor) and drift-injection tasks (CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15), DAIR-FedMoE achieves the highest macro-F1 scores—e.g.\ 89.0 \% on ISCX-VPN and 87.5 \% on ISCX-Tor—outperforming FedAvg by +7.8 and +6.3 percentage points, respectively. Its minority-class recall rises from 65.6 \% under FedAvg to 75.4 \% (+9.8 pp), demonstrating superior sensitivity to underrepresented and drifting labels. Despite the added drift-detection and RL components, communication cost remains modest at 1.10× that of FedAvg, highlighting the framework’s efficiency in parameter exchange.

\paragraph{Learning and Drift-Recovery Curves.}  
Figure X plots per-round macro-F1 on CIC-IDS2017, with synthetic drifts injected at rounds 50 (feature), 100 (concept), and 150 (label). While all methods converge comparably before round 50, DAIR-FedMoE exhibits markedly faster recovery after each drift event. Specifically, it returns to within 5 \% of its pre-drift macro-F1 in approximately 12 rounds, compared to over 40 rounds for FedAvg and 30 rounds for FedDrift. The inset “drift-recovery” curve clearly illustrates our framework’s robustness under successive, co-occurring distribution shifts.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Ablation Studies}

To quantify the contribution of each core module in DAIR-FedMoE, we conduct ablation experiments on the CIC-IDS2017 benchmark by disabling, in turn, (i) the RL-managed expert lifecycle, (ii) the entropy-driven loss reweighting, and (iii) the drift-adaptive MoE routing. Table~III reports the macro-F1 score, minority-class recall, and drift-recovery speed for each variant, while Fig.~Y visualizes the relative degradation in macro-F1 and recall.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{w/o RL management (w/o RP)}: we fix the expert pool to its initial size, i.e.\ no prune/spawn/merge actions.  
	This yields a macro-F1 of 87.4\,\% and a minority recall of 77.0\,\%, compared to 90.2\,\% and 81.5\,\% with the full model, and slows drift recovery from 12 to 18 rounds.
	\item \textbf{w/o adaptive reweighting (w/o IAES)}: we replace confidence-guided loss weights with standard cross-entropy.  
	Macro-F1 falls to 86.3\,\% and recall to 75.2\,\%, with drift recovery requiring 24 rounds.
	\item \textbf{w/o routing (w/o DAMR)}: we collapse the two-tier HMoE into a single shared expert regime.  
	Macro-F1 drops to 86.9\,\% and recall to 76.5\,\%, and drift recovery slows to 20 rounds.
\end{itemize}

These results confirm that each component—RL-based expert resizing, entropy-driven reweighting, and drift-adaptive routing—plays a critical role in maintaining high accuracy, strong minority-class performance, and rapid adaptation under distributed drift.

\subsection{RL Policy Analysis}

To gain deeper insight into the behavior and robustness of our PPO‐based expert lifecycle manager, we examine (i) how the expert pool evolves over time under the learned policy, and (ii) the sensitivity of overall performance to the reward‐weight hyperparameters \(\lambda_d\) and \(\mu\).

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Expert-Pool Evolution (Fig.~Z)}  
	We track the number of active experts at each federated round when running the full DAIR-FedMoE on CIC-IDS2017. As depicted in Fig.~Z, the policy initially spawns specialist experts in response to early feature drifts (rounds 1–50), then prunes underutilized experts once distributions stabilize (rounds 60–100). After the concept-drift event at round 100, a fresh wave of drift experts is spawned, followed by a period of merging redundant experts. The policy thus dynamically adjusts capacity: it grows to a maximum of 12 experts at peak drift, then contracts to 6–8 experts during stable phases, achieving a balance between expressivity and efficiency.
	
	\item \textbf{Sensitivity to \(\lambda_d,\mu\)}  
	We perform a grid search over \(\lambda_d \in \{1.0,2.0,5.0\}\) and \(\mu \in \{0.1,0.5,1.0\}\), measuring macro-F1, minority-class recall, and average expert-pool size at convergence. Table~V summarizes these results. We observe that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Higher \(\lambda_d\) (greater emphasis on drift‐recovery) yields faster adaptation—drift-recovery speed improves by up to 15\%—but modestly increases peak expert count (+2 experts).
		\item Larger \(\mu\) (stronger penalty on expert growth) reduces the average pool size by 20–30\% at the cost of a 1–1.5\,pp drop in macro-F1.
		\item The default setting \(\lambda_d=2.0,\mu=0.5\) strikes a favorable trade-off: it recovers within 12 rounds while maintaining a compact pool of 7–8 experts and high macro-F1 (90.2\%).
	\end{itemize}
	These results demonstrate that the PPO policy is robust across a range of reward‐weight configurations, and that practitioners can tune \(\lambda_d\) and \(\mu\) to prioritize faster adaptation or leaner models according to deployment constraints.
\end{itemize}

		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Hyperparameter Sensitivity}

We evaluate the robustness of DAIR‐FedMoE to two critical hyperparameters: the drift‐estimation window size $W$ and the EMA smoothing factor $\alpha$. We perform a grid search over $W \in \{250, 500, 1000\}$ and $\alpha \in \{0.90, 0.95, 0.99\}$ on the CIC‐IDS2017 benchmark, measuring macro‐F1 and minority‐class recall at convergence. Table~VI summarizes the results.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Window size $W$:}  
	Smaller windows ($W=250$) react more quickly to abrupt feature drifts but can be noisy, yielding a slightly lower macro‐F1 (89.4\,\%) and recall (80.9\,\%). Larger windows ($W=1000$) produce smoother drift estimates but slower adaptation, with macro‐F1 of 89.0\,\% and recall of 80.6\,\%. Our default $W=500$ strikes a balance, achieving 90.2\,\% macro‐F1 and 81.5\,\% recall.
	\item \textbf{EMA factor $\alpha$:}  
	Lower $\alpha=0.90$ places more weight on recent drift scores, improving drift‐recovery speed by 10\% but slightly reducing stability (macro‐F1=89.6\,\%, recall=81.0\,\%). Higher $\alpha=0.99$ yields very stable estimates but slower reaction to drift, with macro‐F1=89.8\,\% and recall=81.3\,\%. We use $\alpha=0.95$ by default for balanced responsiveness and stability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Runtime \& Privacy Budget}

We profile DAIR‐FedMoE’s computational overhead and cumulative privacy loss under $(\varepsilon,\delta)$‐DP across $T=200$ rounds on CIC‐IDS2017. All experiments run on a single server (NVIDIA V100) and clients (CPU Docker containers).

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Per‐round compute cost:}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Client side:} average of 1.8\,s per round for drift scoring, HMoE forward/backward passes, and DP noise addition.
		\item \emph{Server side:} average of 0.6\,s per round for aggregation, PPO inference, and expert pool updates.
	\end{itemize}
	This represents a 1.2× overhead compared to vanilla FedAvg on the same hardware.
	
	\item \textbf{Privacy budget consumption:}  
	Using Gaussian DP‐SGD with gradient clipping $C=1.0$ and noise $\sigma=1.2$, we track the cumulative $(\varepsilon,\delta)$ via the Moments Accountant. After 200 rounds, we observe $\varepsilon \approx 5.4$ with $\delta = 10^{-5}$, confirming that the privacy guarantee remains within acceptable bounds for practical deployments.
